# PandoQ

## Description
PandoQ is the Qt GUI frontend for Pandoc written by using C++ language.

## History
I've decided to write this GUI Pandoc frontend for several reasons:
* Pandoc is the command line tool, and this fact can prevent wide auditory from using it;
* There are several GUI frontends for Pandoc, but non of them was written using C++ language, that is native for Qt framework. For Example:
  *  PanConvert;
  *  Pandoctor.
